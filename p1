#(1).A card is drawn at random from a deck of well-shuffled cards. Find the probability of it being neither a king nor a spade.

total_Cards = 52
total_CardsKings = 4
oneTypeCard = 13
OneTypeCardKing = 1
NonTypeCardKing = total_Cards-(total_CardsKings + oneTypeCard - OneTypeCardKing)
probNonTypeCardsKings=NonTypeCardKing/total_Cards                                 #formula of probability
print('Probability of total Cards Kings, oneTypeCard is',probNonTypeCardsKings)
